# WORDBRO

# Why?

I wanted to see how many times I could write 'bro' and not come up with jibberish. Also, I wanted a place to store all the names for bro that I have heard. People can add their own, too, with some incredibly trivial checks. Will eventually be hosted on [wordbro.co](wordbro.co)

# Running

* `virtualenv flask`
* `flask/bin/pip install flask`
* `flask/bin/pip install pymongo`
* `./server.py`
